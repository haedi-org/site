### Our USP

In the same way that grammar-checking software offers a different service to the text-editor itself, our software can _validate the structure_ of an EDI (electronic data interchange) file, as well as scrutinize the _integrity of the data_ it contains.

It is possible for an EDI file to be correctly structured, and pass many other tests by alternate EDI platforms, while containing completely nonsensical data which would be rejected by the recipient and may result in fines or chargebacks.

With our tool,
- the structure of the document is validated against the relevant standard,
- coded data is cross-referenced against the applicable data sets and code lists,
- standardized formats (ISO formats, GS1 codes, checksums, etc) are checked,
- the cross-referenced document is available for direct interaction and scrutiny,
- the cross-referenced document can be exported in various formats.

### Our market

**Which industries use electronic data interchange?**

Virtually all industries use EDI to one degree or another. The standard is an electronic way for company internal systems to 'talk' to eachother. Invoices, change requests, manufacturing reports, purchase orders, shipping, receiving, payments, and so on, can all be accomplished through EDI.

The industries that use EDI the most are automotive, finance, e-commerce, retail, healthcare, and grocery.

In the supply chain industry, somewhere between 59 and 85% of companies have adopted the technology as apposed to a manual process.
EDI is becoming a more of a requirement to keep transactions succinct which is seeing a large influx of new integrations.

**What are the benefits to moving to an EDI connection?**

- Reduced costs 
- Automated workflows 
- Faster document transmission and transformation
- Smoother relationships with partners and customers
- Fewer errors

However, the errors that do occur can be very difficult to diagnose with the standard being very unintelligible without diagnostic tools.
